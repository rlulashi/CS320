How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Following industry practices such as using writing out comments for better understanding of code. Using proper logic to minimize room for error. Also creating sound
tests that account for different levels of thinking, (Tester mentalility rather than a developer) to purposely discover errors. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Effective communication is a must from the start. It can be tricky to get all the details right on the initial discussion, however during all phases of the 
software development cycle, it is critical to keep the discussions open to promote a sound code based on the user needs. If goals change during this process,
then it will minimize the time and money going into the project that can be spent on creating the correct code, rather than revamp the entire project. 

How do I approach designing software?

I start by outlining my thought process in a flow chart I hand write on a white board. This is just a generalization for me to help get my thoughts in order first.
From there I section out each class and work in small chunks at a time to help not feeling overwhelmed. I make sure to take plenty of breaks and sometimes taking a couple days to then come back I feel more reassured and can focus much easier.
